      <h3><b>About Me</b></h3>
      <h5>What do I want out of life? What are my end goals? How far away from achieving my dreams am I? These are questions we should all probably mull over often. When I think about life, existing, I don't like to imagine myself simply allowing time to slip past me. To just idly waste away, knowing that I never even attempted to live up to all the potential I possess. And Allah has blessed with a lot of it. Masha Allah. To the point where I tend to excel at just about everything I set my mind to. Because I've been granted this gift, among many others, I see myself as someone who doesn't have any excuse to not become as overwhelmingly powerful as I possibly can. Being born with talents and abilities that few others may have puts you in a position where you either cement your legacy as a worthwhile human being or you instead allow yourself to become complacent, without ever giving yourself the opportunity to experience all that you could've been. Going about the motions, letting precious time waste away without even having figured out what I want to do with myself isn't a state I ever enjoy being in. That feeling of hopelessness, not having anything to excite you when you wake up and just being lost is not *living* to me. So I prefer to choose the former way of existing, I want to use what I've been given to make myself even more remarkable than I already am. That's not the only reason I wish to do that, however. As I said, I've had many favors bestowed upon me and those include having a decent amount of material wealth/passive income. In other words, I don't necessarily need to make much of an effort currently to enjoy most of the pleasures I seek from life. So why do I really willingly put myself through hardship, in spite of it not being an immediate requirement? To answer this question, I'll go back to something I've previously stated an obnoxious number of times. As a man, I attain satisfaction, fulfillment from giving back to the ones I love and to those who are there for me when I need them. To me, giving back involves becoming the best version of me, both for them and for myself. My father used to say, "What you are is a gift from God. What you make of it is a gift to God". I love Allah the most so ideally, if I do enhance myself, it should be for Him more than anyone. My brother has told me that when he's questioned on the day of judgement about what he has brought with him, he plans to put me on display as his most tremendous success since he views and treats me as his personal project. This, to me, is a great honor, of course. And more recently, another person quite dear to me mentioned that they want me to succeed at everything. I intend to live up to those expectations as well as other positive ones that people have had of me cause what better way is there to show my appreciation and love for all the names I brought up than to simply strive to get to the highest level of power I can hope to reach and then provide the choicest value I can to each and every one of them. If I do have kids someday which, Insha Allah, I will, I would most certainly like to instill similar values in them. I suppose becoming capable of supporting and taking care of a family of my own, without needing to rely on my parents' wealth for it is a goal for me too. I'd like to be able to satiate all of my wife and kids' wants and requirements; financial, emotional or otherwise. That and I want to bring about change in this world, overly idealistic as that may sound, by helping those in need (starting with the ones closest to me), relentlessly and unwaveringly taking a stand against wickedness and tyranny, once I have accumulated enough strength and ultimately, dedicating myself fully to living and dying in Allah's Cause. That is my greatest mission in life and although it doesn't mean I have to neglect my family and friends at that point, it does mean that I can not make them more of a priority than what I believe I was sent here for; what my paramount goal is. <span class="w3-opacity">April 7, 2014</span></h5>
